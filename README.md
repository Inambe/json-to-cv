# Make Resume

> Create your Resume/CV yet keeping data separate from the design

Make Resume is a CLI tool to create your Resume from a JSON file. Storing information in a JSON file helps track, compare, and version your Resume as it's just a file with some readable text on it and one command away from a beautifully designed Resume.
