# Make Resume

Make Resume is a tool to build a Resume/CV yet keeping data separate from design.

Storing information in a readable-text format i.e. `JSON` helps track, compare, clone, and version your resume as it's just a file with some readable text on it and just one command away from a beautifully designed Resume.
