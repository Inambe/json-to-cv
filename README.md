# Make Resume

Make Resume is a tool to build a Resume yet keeping data separate from design. It helps track, compare, clone, and version your resume as it's just a file with some readable text on it and just one command away from a beautifully designed Resume.

## Theme Library

There is only one theme available right now but I'm hoping for contribution from people. Let me know if you need information regarding that.
